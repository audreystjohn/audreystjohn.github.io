    <h2>Try out this simple version of Wordle!</h2>

    You have 6 attempts to guess the secret word by entering 5-letter words.
    As you guess, you'll receive a clue under each letter. <br/><br/>
    ♥ Correct letter in the correct spot<br/>
    ♡ Correct letter in the incorrect spot<br/>
    <b>_</b> Incorrect letter (not in the secret word)<br/><br/>


   If you enter something that is not a valid 5-letter word, your guess will
   be rejected (you'll see ".....").
    <br/><br/>
    Good luck!
    <br/><br/>

    <p>
      Enter your 5-letter guess: <br/>
      <input id="userGuess" /><br/>
      <button id="goBtn" onclick="enterWord()">Go!</button>
    </p>
